My wife accused me of being a transvestite.
So I packed her things and left.

I told my wife she drew her eyebrows too high.
She seemed surprised.

Wife: “I’m sick of you pretending you’re a detective!, I think we should split up”.
Me: “Good idea. We can cover more ground that way”

My wife’s a terrible cook, she can never get her sauces right!
I’ve stuck with her though, through thick and thin.

My wife said she will leave me.
She said I was too passive, and didn’t stand up for myself enough.
I can’t really argue with that.

My wife broke up with me recently because I’m a compulsive gambler.
All I can think about is how to win her back.

My wife just texted me to say she’s made a Voodoo doll of me.
I think she’s pulling my leg.
